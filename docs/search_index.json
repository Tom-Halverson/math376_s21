You should upload your assignment under the PS1 link on Moodle. You can hand write your solutions and scan them, or typeset them in R or LaTex. But you should upload the assignment in a single PDF or a single HTML file. Ideally, submit the problems in order, but if that is not possible, the problems should be clearly labeled. You should justify all answers, unless the assignment is to compute something. Then you should clearly display your computed work. All assignments will be out of 30 points. For example, this assignment has six 5-point problems. Late work: assignments will be lowered by 10% each day they are late. The solution will be posted on Tuesday. From that point on, I will still accept assignment write-ups, but you can earn a maximum of half of the points. Collaboration is encouraged. In fact, it has been shown that people who form study groups, and talk about assignments, learn more and perform better. However, you should write up your own work in your own words (blatent copying is not acceptable), and if you receive substantial help from a classmate, you should give that person credit in your write-up (no pentalty for this!). 1.1 Modular Multiplication Make the multiplication tables of the following sets and determine which of them are groups under multiplication. You can do this by hand (encouraged to get the feel for it) or using the R commands in Modular Arithmetic. \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\) using multiplication mod 4 \\(\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\) using multiplication mod 5 \\(\\{1,5,7,11\\}\\) using multiplication mod 12 \\(\\{5,15,25,35\\}\\) using multiplication mod 40 1.2 Group of Units \\(U(n)\\) mod n Let \\(U(n) = \\{1 \\le k &lt; n \\mid 1 = \\gcd(k,n) \\}\\). These are the elements of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_n\\) that are relatively prime to \\(n\\). In this problem, we will explore this set and prove that it is a group. Notice: by definition \\(U(n)\\) has the multiplicative identity 1, since \\(gcd(1,n) = 1\\). And, multiplication mod n is associative. So, we need to make sure it is a binary operation on \\(U(n)\\) and that \\(U(n)\\) is closed under taking inverses. Compute the sets \\(U(6),U(7),U(8)\\). Use the R-code in Modular Arithmetic to do the following (you can do it by hand if you prefer). Make the multiplication tables of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_8\\) and \\(U(8)\\) mod 8. Make the multiplication table of \\(U(9)\\). Make the multiplication table of \\(U(14)\\). Show that if \\(a \\in U(n)\\) then \\(a\\) has a multiplicative inverse in \\(U(n)\\). Hint: use the Extended GCD from Chapter 0, the cyclic groups voicethread, and Modular Arithmetic. Show that \\(U(n)\\) is closed under multiplication. That is if \\(a, b \\in U(n)\\), then \\(ab \\in U(n)\\). This shows that multiplication mod \\(n\\) is a binary operation on \\(U(n)\\). Hint 1: if \\(a\\) is invertible mod n and \\(b\\) is invertible mod n, then must \\(ab\\) be invertible mod \\(n\\). Hint 2: think about your shoes and socks. Are \\(U(8)\\), \\(U(9)\\), and/or \\(U(14)\\) cyclic? Justify your answers. 1.3 Two-by-two mod 2 The group \\(GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_2)\\) is the group of all invertible \\(2\\times 2\\) matrices with entries from \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\{0,1\\}\\) and all arithmetic done mod 2. That is, \\[ GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\left\\{ A=\\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d \\end{pmatrix} \\mid a,b,c,d \\in \\{0,1\\} \\hbox{ and $A$ is invertible} \\right\\}. \\] The operation is usual matrix multiplication with arithmetic done mod 2 so that: 0+0 = 0, 0+1 = 1+0 = 1, 1+1 = 0. There are 16 matrices of this form (two choices 0 or 1 for each of the four matrix entries), determine which of these are invertible (you can use the determinant mod 2). Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be the matrices below \\[ A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\qquad\\hbox{and}\\qquad B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{pmatrix}. \\] Show that every element in this group is of the form \\(A^i B^j\\) for some powers \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) (these powers can be 0). Since \\(BA\\) is in the group, it must be equal to \\(A^i B^j\\) for some \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). Find \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). 1.4 Outer Cancellation A group \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) has the special property that for all \\(x,y,z \\in G\\), if \\(xy = zx\\) then \\(y = z\\). Prove that \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) is abelian. 1.5 Distributing Powers Prove that for \\(a, b\\) in a group \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) we have \\[ (ab)^2=a^2b^2 \\quad \\hbox{ if and only if } \\quad ab=ba. \\] 1.6 Cyclic Subgroups If \\(g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\), then \\(\\langle g \\rangle \\le \\mathsf{G}\\) is the smallest subgroup of \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) that contains \\(g\\). We will show in class that \\[ \\begin{array}{rcll} \\langle g \\rangle &amp;=&amp; \\{ g^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}, &amp; \\hbox{if $|g| = \\infty$}.\\\\ \\langle g \\rangle &amp;=&amp; \\{1, g, g^2, \\ldots, g^{n-1}\\}, \\quad &amp; \\hbox{if $|g| = n$}.\\\\ \\end{array} \\] Compute the elements of the following cyclic subgroups. \\(\\langle 5 \\rangle \\le \\mathbb{Z}\\) \\(\\langle 5 \\rangle \\le \\mathbb{Z}_{30}\\) \\(\\langle 5 \\rangle \\le \\mathbb{R}^\\ast\\) \\(\\langle 5 \\rangle \\le U({28})\\) \\(\\langle (\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}i) \\rangle \\le \\mathbb{C}^\\ast\\) "],["problem-set-2.html", "Section 2 Problem Set 2 2.1 Complex Roots of Unity. 2.2 Permutation Computations 2.3 Conjugate Subgroups 2.4 Subgroup of Squares 2.5 Half of a Subgroup 2.6 Symmetry group of the cube 2.7 Extra Credit", " Section 2 Problem Set 2 Due: Friday April 2, 5:00PM CST.

However, you should write up your own work in your own words (blatent copying is not acceptable), and if you receive substantial help from a classmate, you should give that person credit in your write-up (no pentalty for this!). 2.1 Complex Roots of Unity. Let \\(C_{12}\\) be the group consisting of the 12 complex roots of \\(x^{12} - 1 = 0.\\) Draw a picture of this group in the complex plane \\(\\mathbb{C}^\\ast\\). Color in blue each of the points in this group which are generators of \\(C_{12}\\). Draw the subgroup lattice of \\(C_{12}\\). Choose a color for each subgroup (the whole group is blue) and color the generators of each subgroup in your original picture. Each group element should get a color this way. You don’t have to show any work. In your answer to part (a) all of the elements of the group should have a color and your answer to part (b) should indicate which color is associated with which subgroup. Show that the sum of the elements of \\(C_{12}\\) is 0. Do it as follows. We know that \\(x = 1\\) is one of the roots of \\(x^{12} - 1\\). Divide \\((x-1)\\) into \\(x^{12}-1\\) using “old school” polynomial long division. Use your resulting polynomial to answer the questions. 2.2 Permutation Computations The following permutation is given as a product of non-joint cycles in \\(\\mathsf{S}_6\\). Write it in disjoint cycle notation. \\[ \\sigma = (123456) (632)(134)(25) (316) \\] Write the permutation below (a) in disjoint cycle notation, (b) as a product of transpositions, and (c) as a product of adjacent transpositions. Give a different asnwer to (b) than you give for (c). \\[ \\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 \\\\ 4 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 7 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 3 \\\\ \\end{pmatrix} \\] The symmetric group \\(\\mathsf{S}_6\\) has 720 elements. How many of these elements have order 2? How many of these elements have order 4? Justify your answers. The symmetric group \\(\\mathsf{S}_{10}\\) has 3.6 million elements in it. Find a permutation \\(\\sigma \\in \\mathsf{S}_{10}\\) of maximum order. You don’t need to prove that your answer is correct, but describe your strategy. 2.3 Conjugate Subgroups If \\(\\mathsf{H}\\le \\mathsf{G}\\) and \\(g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\) define \\(g \\mathsf{H}g^{-1} = \\{ g h g^{-1} \\mid h \\in \\mathsf{H}\\}\\). This is called the conjugate of \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) by \\(g\\). Prove that \\(g \\mathsf{H}g^{-1}\\) is a subgroup of \\(\\mathsf{G}\\). In the dihedral group \\(D_4\\) find the conjugate subgroup \\(g \\mathsf{H}g^{-1}\\) in the following two cases: \\(\\mathsf{H}= \\{1, f\\}\\) and \\(g = r\\). \\(\\mathsf{H}= \\{1, r^2, f, r^2 f\\}\\) and \\(g = r\\). In the symmetric group \\(S_4\\) of permutations of \\(\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\) let \\(\\mathsf{H}= \\{ \\sigma \\in S_4 \\mid \\sigma(3) = 3 \\}\\) be the subgroup that fixes 3. Compute \\(\\alpha \\mathsf{H}\\alpha^{-1}\\) if \\(\\alpha = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\\\ 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\end{pmatrix}\\). What do the permutations in \\(\\alpha \\mathsf{H}\\alpha^{-1}\\) have in common? 2.4 Subgroup of Squares In a group \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) define the set of squares to be \\(K = \\{ g^2 \\mid g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\}.\\) Prove that if \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) is abelian, then \\(K \\le \\mathsf{G}\\). In \\({\\mathsf{A}}_4\\) (the alternating group of even permutations in \\(\\mathsf{S}_4\\) discussed on Tuesday), find two permutations \\(a,b\\in {\\mathsf{A}}_4\\) such that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are each squares (i.e., \\(a = x^2\\) and \\(b = y^2\\) for \\(x,y \\in {\\mathsf{A}}_4\\)) but \\(ab\\) is not a square. This shows that if \\(G\\) is nonabelian \\(K\\) may not be a subgroup (this is the smallest group that exhibits this phenomenon). 2.5 Half of a Subgroup Prove that if \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) is a subgroup of \\(\\mathsf{S}_n\\) then either \\(\\mathsf{H}\\le {\\mathsf{A}}_n\\) or exactly half of \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) is even and half of \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) is odd. Hint: If \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) has an element \\(\\alpha\\) of odd order, then define a map \\[ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\mathsf{H}&amp;\\to&amp; \\mathsf{H}\\\\ h &amp; \\mapsto &amp; h \\alpha \\\\ \\end{array} \\] Argue that the image of this map is \\(\\mathsf{H}\\)? What does this map do to even elements? to odd elements? Prove: If \\(\\mathsf{H}\\le \\mathsf{S}_n\\) has odd order, then \\(\\mathsf{H}\\le {\\mathsf{A}}_n\\). 2.6 Symmetry group of the cube The symmetric group \\(\\mathsf{S}_4\\) is isomorphic to the rotation group of a cube. There are four long diagonals of the cube. In the picture below, these diagonals connect the vertices labeled 1 to one another, the vertices labeled 2 to one another, the vertices labeled 3 to one another, and the vertices labeled 4 to one another. (They are color coded). The rotation corresponding to the permutation \\(\\sigma \\in \\mathsf{S}_4\\) permutes diagonal \\(i\\) to diagonal \\(j\\) if \\(\\sigma(i) = j\\). For example, the rotation corresponding to the 4-cycle \\(\\sigma = (1,2,3,4)\\) is shown here. Find the rotation corresponding to each of the permutations below (given below in cycle notation). For each of them, indicate the axes of rotation and the number of radians (and direction) that you rotate by, and give the before and after picture with the vertices labeled and colored as I have done above for \\((1,2,3,4)\\). \\((1,2)\\) \\((1,2,3)\\) \\((1,2)(3,4)\\) I recommend using a paper model of the cube. 2.7 Extra Credit (2 pts) Give, with proof, a formula for the number of permutations of cycle type \\(\\mu = [\\mu_1, \\mu_2, \\ldots, \\mu_\\ell]\\).

No penalty if turned in by noon on Saturday. Same rules as previous assignments. 3.1 Centralizer is a Group Invariant Suppose that \\(\\phi: \\mathsf{G}_1 \\to \\mathsf{G}_2\\) is a group isomorphism. Let \\(a \\in \\mathsf{G}_1\\) and recall that the centralizer of \\(a\\) in \\(\\mathsf{G}_1\\) is the subgroup \\[ C_{\\mathsf{G}_1}(a) = \\{ g \\in \\mathsf{G}_1 \\mid g a = a g\\} \\le \\mathsf{G}_1. \\] Prove that \\(\\phi(C_{\\mathsf{G}_1}(a)) = C_{\\mathsf{G}_2}(\\phi(a))\\). Hint: use the fact that \\(\\phi\\) is one-to-one and onto. 3.2 Dihedral Cosets In this problem, we will work with the dihedral group \\(\\mathsf{D}_{12}\\) for the 12-gon pictured below. Per usual, let \\(r\\) be rotation by \\(2 \\pi/12\\) counter-clockwise, and let \\(f\\) be the flip over the horizontal axis. Then \\[ \\mathsf{D}_{12} = \\{1, r, r^2, \\ldots, r^{11}, f, r f, r^2 f, \\ldots, r^{11} f\\}. \\] Let \\(\\mathsf{H}\\le \\mathsf{D}_{12}\\) be the subgroup that fixes the square below in the sense that the square has to go to the square (it can rotate or flip the square but it has to end up in the same place). Find \\(\\mathsf{H}\\). It makes sense that \\(\\mathsf{H}\\cong \\mathsf{D}_4\\) since it it rotates and flips the square. Give an isomorphism \\(\\phi: \\mathsf{D}_4 \\to \\mathsf{H}\\) (just state your isomorphism). Let \\(R\\) and \\(F\\) be the generators of \\(\\mathsf{D}_4\\) to distinguish them from the generators of \\(\\mathsf{D}_{12}\\). Show that \\(\\phi(R)^4 = 1\\), \\(\\phi(F)^2 = 1\\), and \\(\\phi(F)\\phi(R) = \\phi(R)^3 \\phi(F)\\). This proves that \\(\\phi\\) is an isomorphism, since these are the defining relations of \\(\\mathsf{D}_4\\). Decompose \\(\\mathsf{D}_{12}\\) into left \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) cosets. The elements of each coset share a common property related to the image. What is it? 3.3 Fermat’s “Little” Theorem The point of this problem is to show that some of the important properties of modular arithmetic and coding theory actually come from group theory. Recall that \\(U(n) = \\{ 1 \\le k &lt; n \\mid \\gcd(k,n) = 1\\}\\) is the group of units under multiplication mod \\(n\\). Let \\(\\phi(n) = |U(n)|\\), so that \\(\\phi(n)\\) is the number of positive integers less than \\(n\\) that are relatively prime to \\(n\\). Fill out the table \\[ \\begin{array}{|c|ccccccccccc|} \\hline n &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 &amp; 10 &amp; 11 &amp; 12 \\\\ \\hline \\phi(n) &amp; &amp; &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] Prove that \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 (\\mathsf{mod}\\ n)\\). (Hint: use a corollary of Lagrange’s Theorem). Demonstrate that b works for \\(n = 12\\) and each \\(a \\in U(12)\\). Use part (b) to prove the following, which is called Fermat’s Little Theorem: \\(a^{p} \\equiv a (\\mathsf{mod}\\ p)\\) for a prime number \\(p\\). Demonstrate Fermat’s Little Theorem for \\(p = 7\\) and each number in \\(U(7)\\). 3.4 Index of the Center Prove that in a finite group \\(\\mathsf{G}\\), the index of the center \\([G:Z(\\mathsf{G})]\\) cannot be prime. (Hint: let \\(a \\in \\mathsf{G}\\setminus Z(\\mathsf{G})\\) and consider the centralizer \\(C_\\mathsf{G}(a)\\)). That is, \\(a \\in \\mathsf{G}\\) but \\(a \\not \\in Z(\\mathsf{G})\\). 3.5 Quaternion Quotient Recall the quaternion group \\(Q_8 = \\{1,-1,i,-i,j,-j,k,-k\\}\\). Show that \\(H = \\{1,-1\\}\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(Q_8\\). The quotient group \\(Q_8/H\\) has order 2. You have proved that, up to isomorphism, there are two groups of order 4. They are \\(\\mathbb{Z}_4\\) and the Klein-4 group \\(K_4 = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2\\). Which of these two groups is \\(Q_8/H\\) isomorphic to? 3.6 A Matrix Quotient Let \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) be defined as below: \\[ \\mathsf{G}= \\left\\{\\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\\\ 0 &amp; c \\end{bmatrix} \\mid a,b,c \\in \\mathbb{R}, ac \\not=0 \\right\\} \\hskip.5in \\mathsf{H}= \\left\\{\\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; d \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\mid d \\in \\mathbb{R}\\right\\}. \\] Then \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) is a group under matrix multiplication (note: \\(ac\\) is the determinant of the matrix so \\(ac \\not = 0\\) means that that the matrix is invertible). Show that \\(\\mathsf{H}\\le \\mathsf{G}\\). Show that \\(\\mathsf{H}\\trianglelefteq \\mathsf{G}\\). Find a set \\(X\\) that consists of exactly one matrix from each coset of \\(\\mathsf{G}/\\mathsf{H}\\). 3.7 Extra Credit We proved that if \\(\\mathsf{H}\\trianglelefteq \\mathsf{G}\\), then coset multiplication on \\(\\mathsf{G}/\\mathsf{H}\\) is well-defined. Prove the other direction: if coset multiplication is well-defined, then \\(\\mathsf{H}\\trianglelefteq \\mathsf{G}\\). This shows that \\(\\mathsf{G}/\\mathsf{H}\\) is a group if and only if \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) is a normal subgroup.

Time will be provided in class to work on these and discuss them with your peers. This problem set has 4 problems. 4.1 Boolean Rings Let \\(R\\) be a ring in which \\(a^2 = a\\) for every \\(a \\in R.\\) Prove that \\(a = -a\\) in this ring. Prove that \\(R\\) is commutative. (Hint: cleverly use the \\(a^2 = a\\) property and don’t forget that we have addition in \\(R\\) but we don’t have cancellation). Prove that if \\(R\\) has unity and \\(a \\not= 0,1\\) then \\(a\\) is a zero divisor. \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2 =\\{0,1\\}\\) is a Boolean ring with 2 elements. Give an example of a Boolean ring with unity having 4 elements. 4.2 Subsets, Subrings, and Ideals Each example below describes a subset \\(S \\subseteq R\\). Determine (with proof) whether \\(S\\) is “just” a subset or is a subring or is an ideal. \\(R = \\mathbb{Z}[x]\\) and \\(S\\) is the set of polynomials with 0 constant term: \\(S = \\{ p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \\cdots + a_n x^n \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x] \\mid a_0 = 0\\}\\). \\(R = \\mathbb{Z}[x]\\) and \\(S\\) is the set of polynomials with an even constant term: \\(S = \\{ p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \\cdots + a_n x^n \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x] \\mid a_0 \\in 2 \\mathbb{Z}\\}\\). \\(R = \\mathbb{Z}[x]\\) and \\(S\\) is the set of polynomials with a zero quadratic term: \\(S = \\{ p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \\cdots + a_n x^n \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]\\mid a_2 = 0 \\}\\). \\(R\\) is a commutative ring, \\(a \\in R\\), and \\(S = \\{ r \\in R \\mid r a = 0 \\}\\). \\(R\\) is a ring and \\(S = \\{ s \\in R \\mid s r = r s \\text{ for all } r \\in R\\}\\). 4.3 Gaussian Quotient Ring Let \\(I = \\langle 2 + 2 i \\rangle \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}[i]\\). That is, \\(I\\) is a principal ideal in the ring of Gaussian integers. List the distinct cosets in \\(\\mathbb{Z}[i]/I\\). Find the units in \\(\\mathbb{Z}[i]/I\\). Give each unit with its inverse. If \\(\\mathbb{Z}[i]/I\\) has zero divisors, give an example of one. Where in the Venn diagram of rings does \\(\\mathbb{Z}[i]/I\\) live? Is \\(I\\) a prime ideal? Is \\(I\\) a maximal ideal? In each case, say why or why not. 4.4 Radicals Let \\(R\\) be a commutative ring, let \\(A\\) be any ideal of \\(R\\), define the radical of \\(A\\) to be \\[ N(A) = \\{ r \\in R \\mid r^n \\in A \\text{ for some positive integer } n\\} \\] (the integer \\(n\\) can be different for different choices of \\(r\\)). Prove that \\(N(A)\\) is an ideal of \\(R\\). Give an example where \\(N(A) = A\\) and an example where \\(A \\subsetneqq N(A)\\). The nilradical of \\(R\\) is \\(N(\\{0\\})\\). Find (with proof) the nilradical of \\(R/N(A)\\) for any ideal \\(A\\). That is, state what it is and then prove your statement. Here is a movie (coming: mov|pdf) that might clarify things. "],["group-basics.html", "Section 5 Group Basics 5.1 Groups 5.2 Subgroups 5.3 Cyclic Groups 5.4 Isomorphisms", " Section 5 Group Basics 5.1 Groups Def: A group is a set \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) with a binary operation \\(\\ast\\) that satisfies the following: (Identity) There exists \\(e \\in \\mathsf{G}\\) such that: if \\(g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\), then \\(e \\ast g= g \\ast e = g\\). (Inverse) If \\(g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\), then there exists \\(g^{-1} \\in \\mathsf{G}\\) so that \\(g \\ast g^{-1} = g^{-1} \\ast g = e\\). (Associativity) If \\(a,b,c \\in \\mathsf{G}\\), then \\((ab)c = a (bc)\\). Furthermore, the group is abelian if it also satisfies the commutative property: (Commutative) If \\(a,b \\in \\mathsf{G}\\), then \\(ab = ba\\). Proposition (Uniqueness) Let \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) be a group. Then \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) has a unique identity element \\(e\\). If \\(a,b,c \\in \\mathsf{G}\\) and \\(ab = e\\) and \\(ca = e\\), then \\(a = c\\). If \\(g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\) then t here is a unique element \\(g^{-1}\\) such that \\(g g^{-1} = g^{-1} g = e\\).

Proposition (\\(ax =b\\)) Let \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) be a group and \\(a,b \\in \\mathsf{G}\\). The equation \\(a x = b\\) has a unique solution \\(x = a^{-1} b\\). The equation \\(x a = b\\) has a unique solution \\(x = b a^{-1}\\). Proposition (Latin Square) Let \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) be a group and \\(a \\in \\mathsf{G}\\). The function \\(\\mathsf{G}\\to \\mathsf{G}\\) defined by left multiplication by \\(a\\), \\(g \\mapsto a g\\), is one-to-one and onto. The function \\(\\mathsf{G}\\to \\mathsf{G}\\) defined by right multiplication by \\(a\\), \\(g \\mapsto g a\\), is one-to-one and onto. 5.2 Subgroups Def: A subset \\(\\mathsf{H}\\subseteq \\mathsf{G}\\) of a group \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) is a subgroup if \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) is a group under the same binary operation that it inherits from \\(\\mathsf{G}\\). We write \\(\\mathsf{H}\\le \\mathsf{G}\\) to denote that \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) is a subgroup of \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) and write \\(\\mathsf{H}&lt; \\mathsf{G}\\) if \\(\\mathsf{H}\\le \\mathsf{G}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{H}\\not= \\mathsf{G}\\). Theorem: (Subgroup Test) A nonempty subset \\(\\mathsf{H}\\subseteq \\mathsf{G}\\) is a subgroup if (identity) \\(e \\in \\mathsf{H}\\), where \\(e\\) is the identity in \\(\\mathsf{G}\\). (closure) If \\(h_1, h_2 \\in \\mathsf{H}\\), then \\(h_1 h_2 \\in \\mathsf{H}\\). (contains inverses) If \\(h \\in \\mathsf{H}\\), then \\(h^{-1} \\in \\mathsf{H}\\). Note: (a) follows from (b) and (c). Def: The order of an element \\(g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\) is the smallest positive integer \\(m\\) such that \\(g^m = e\\), and we write \\(|g| = m\\). If there is no such \\(m\\), then \\(|g| = \\infty\\). Def: The center of a group \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) is the following subgroup \\[ Z(\\mathsf{G}) = \\{ a \\in \\mathsf{G}\\mid \\hbox{ if $g \\in \\mathsf{G}$ then $ag = ga$ } \\}. \\] Def: If \\(g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\) then \\(\\langle g \\rangle\\) is the smallest subgroup of \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) that contains \\(g\\). It is called the cyclic subgroup generated by \\(g\\). This subgroup contains all possible powers of \\(g\\): \\[ \\langle g \\rangle = \\{ g^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}. \\] 5.3 Cyclic Groups A group \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) is cyclic if \\(\\mathsf{G}= \\langle g \\rangle\\) for some \\(g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\). Theorem. (Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups) If \\(\\mathsf{G}= \\langle g\\rangle\\), then Every subgroup \\(\\mathsf{H}\\le \\mathsf{G}\\) is cyclic (thus, \\(\\mathsf{H}= \\langle g^k \\rangle\\)). If \\(|g| = \\infty\\) then \\(\\langle g \\rangle = \\{ \\ldots, g^{-3}, g^{-2}, g^{-1}, 1, g, g^2, g^3, \\ldots \\}\\) and all of these elements are distinct. If \\(|g| = n\\) then \\(\\langle g \\rangle = \\{1, g, g^2, \\ldots, g^{n-1} \\}\\) and all of these elements are distinct (thus, \\(|g| = |\\langle g \\rangle|\\)). If \\(|g| = n\\) then the subgroups of \\(\\langle g \\rangle\\) satisfy: \\(\\langle g^k \\rangle = \\langle g^d \\rangle\\), where \\(d = \\gcd(k,n)\\). \\(|\\langle g^k \\rangle| = \\frac{n}{d}= \\frac{n}{\\gcd(k,n)}\\), which is a divisor of \\(n\\). If \\(\\ell \\vert n\\), then \\(|\\langle g^{n/\\ell} \\rangle|\\) is a subgroup of size \\(\\ell\\) and is the only subgroup of size \\(\\ell\\). Note: (d) says that, in a finite cyclic group of order \\(n\\), there is exactly one subgroup for each divisor of \\(n\\) and those are all the subgroups. 5.4 Isomorphisms Def: An isomorphism between groups \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) is a function \\(\\phi: \\mathsf{G}\\to \\mathsf{H}\\) such that \\(\\phi\\) is and (a bijection) and \\[ \\phi( a b) = \\phi(a) \\phi(b). \\] We write \\(\\mathsf{G}\\cong \\mathsf{H}\\) to denote that \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) are isomorphic. Theorem (Properties of Isomorphisms): if \\(\\phi: \\mathsf{G}\\to \\mathsf{H}\\) is an isomorphism, and $g then \\(\\phi(e_\\mathsf{G}) = e_\\mathsf{H}\\). \\(\\phi(g^{-1}) = \\phi(g)^{-1}\\) \\(\\phi(g^k) = \\phi(g)^k\\) for all \\(k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) \\(|g| = |\\phi(g)|\\) \\(\\phi^{-1}: \\mathsf{H}\\to \\mathsf{G}\\) is an isomorphism If \\(K \\le \\mathsf{G}\\) then \\(\\phi(\\mathsf{K}) \\le H\\) where \\(\\phi(\\mathsf{K}) = \\{ \\phi(k) \\mid k \\in \\mathsf{K}\\}\\). \\(|\\mathsf{G}| = |\\mathsf{H}|\\) \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) is abelian if and only if \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) is abelian \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) is cyclic if and only if \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) is cyclic \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) has \\(k\\) elements of order \\(m\\) if and only if \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) has \\(k\\) elements of order \\(m\\).

Parts (a) and (e) tell us that cosets partition the group into a set of disjoint subsets whose union is \\(\\mathsf{G}\\). Part (f) tells us that these subsets all have the same size. This can be pictured as: Def: The index of \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) in \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) is \\[ [\\mathsf{G}:\\mathsf{H}] = \\#(\\text{cosets of } \\mathsf{H}\\text{ in } \\mathsf{G}). \\] The following theorem follows immediately from the fact that the cosets partition the group and they are all the same size: Lagrange’s Theorem: \\(|\\mathsf{G}| = |\\mathsf{H}| [\\mathsf{G}:\\mathsf{H}]\\). Corollary 1: If \\(|\\mathsf{G}|\\) is finite, then \\(|\\mathsf{H}|\\) divides \\(|\\mathsf{G}|\\) (this is often written as \\(|\\mathsf{H}|\\, \\big\\vert \\,|\\mathsf{G}|)\\). Corollary 2: If \\(|\\mathsf{G}| = p\\) (prime), then the only subgroups of \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) are \\(\\{e\\}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) (i.e, \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) has no nontrivial, proper subgroups). Corollary 3: If \\(g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\), then \\(|g| = |\\langle g \\rangle|\\) divides \\(|G|\\). Corollary 4: If \\(|\\mathsf{G}|\\) is finite and \\(g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\), then \\(g^{|\\mathsf{G}|} = e\\). Corollary 5: If \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) is finite and \\(\\mathsf{H}\\le \\mathsf{K}\\le \\mathsf{G}\\), then \\([\\mathsf{G}:\\mathsf{H}] = [\\mathsf{G}:\\mathsf{K}] [\\mathsf{K}:\\mathsf{H}]\\). 6.2 Normal Subgroups Def: A subgroup \\(\\mathsf{H}\\le \\mathsf{G}\\) is normal if \\(g \\mathsf{H}= \\mathsf{H}g\\) for all \\(g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\). We write \\(\\mathsf{H}\\trianglelefteq \\mathsf{G}\\) to indicate that \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) is normal in \\(\\mathsf{G}\\), and we write \\(\\mathsf{H}\\triangleleft \\mathsf{G}\\) if \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) is a proper normal subgroup of \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) (i.e. \\(\\mathsf{G}\\not= \\mathsf{H}\\)). Examples: \\(\\{e \\}\\trianglelefteq \\mathsf{G}\\). \\(\\mathsf{G}\\trianglelefteq \\mathsf{G}\\). If \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) is abelian, then every subgroup of \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) is normal. The center \\(Z(\\mathsf{G})\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(\\mathsf{G}\\). Proposition (Normal Subgroup Test): If \\(\\mathsf{H}\\le \\mathsf{G}\\) then \\[ \\mathsf{H}\\trianglelefteq \\mathsf{G}\\qquad \\text {if and only if } \\qquad \\text{$g h g^{-1} \\in \\mathsf{H}$ for all $g \\in \\mathsf{G}$ and all $h \\in \\mathsf{H}$}. \\] 6.3 Quotient Groups Def: \\(\\mathsf{G}/\\mathsf{H}= \\{ g \\mathsf{H}\\mid g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\}\\) is the set of left cosets of \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) in \\(\\mathsf{G}\\). Note that \\[ \\left| \\frac{\\mathsf{G}}{\\mathsf{H}} \\right| = [\\mathsf{G}: \\mathsf{H}] = \\frac{|\\mathsf{G}|}{|\\mathsf{H}|}, \\] where the second equality only makes sense if \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) is finite. Def (Coset Multiplication): If \\(a \\mathsf{H}, b \\mathsf{H}\\in \\mathsf{G}/\\mathsf{H}\\), then we define \\((a \\mathsf{H}) (b \\mathsf{H}) = ab \\mathsf{H}\\). Theorem: If \\(\\mathsf{H}\\trianglelefteq \\mathsf{G}\\), then coset multiplication is well-defined. That is, if \\(a&#39; \\in a \\mathsf{H}\\) and \\(b&#39; \\in b \\mathsf{H}\\), then \\(a&#39; b&#39; \\mathsf{H}= ab \\mathsf{H}\\). This makes coset multiplication a binary operation on \\(\\mathsf{G}/\\mathsf{H}\\). Therefore, if \\(\\mathsf{H}\\trianglelefteq \\mathsf{G}\\), then the set of cosets \\(\\mathsf{G}/\\mathsf{H}\\) forms a group under coset multiplication. Such that The identity is \\(e \\mathsf{H}= \\mathsf{H}\\) since \\((e \\mathsf{H}) (g \\mathsf{H}) = e g \\mathsf{H}= g \\mathsf{H}\\). The inverse of \\(g \\mathsf{H}\\) is \\(g^{-1} \\mathsf{H}\\) since \\((g \\mathsf{H}) (g^{-1} \\mathsf{H}) = g g^{-1} \\mathsf{H}= \\mathsf{H}\\). 6.4 Homomorphisms Def: If \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) are groups, then a homomorphism from \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) to \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) is a function \\(\\phi: \\mathsf{G}\\to \\mathsf{H}\\) such that, if \\(a,b \\in \\mathsf{G}\\), then \\[ \\phi( a b) = \\phi(a) \\phi(b). \\] Theorem (Properties of Homomorphisms): if \\(\\phi: \\mathsf{G}\\to \\mathsf{H}\\) is a homomorphism, and \\(g \\in \\mathsf{G},\\) then \\(\\phi(e_\\mathsf{G}) = e_\\mathsf{H}\\). \\(\\phi(g^{-1}) = \\phi(g)^{-1}\\) \\(\\phi(g^k) = \\phi(g)^k\\) for all \\(k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) \\(|\\phi(g)|\\, \\Big\\vert\\, |g|\\) If \\(K \\le \\mathsf{G}\\) then \\(\\phi(\\mathsf{K}) \\le H\\) where \\(\\phi(\\mathsf{K}) = \\{ \\phi(k) \\mid k \\in \\mathsf{K}\\}\\). Def: if \\(\\phi: \\mathsf{G}\\to \\mathsf{H}\\) is an homomorphism, then the kernel and image of \\(\\phi\\) are the following subsets of \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{H}\\), respectively, \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathsf{Ker}(\\phi) &amp;= \\{ g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\mid \\phi(g) = e_H\\} \\\\ \\mathsf{Im}(\\phi) &amp;= \\{ h \\in \\mathsf{H}\\mid \\text{there is at least one } g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\text{ such that } \\phi(g) = h \\} \\\\ &amp;= \\{ \\phi(g) \\mid g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\} \\end{align*}\\] Theorem. If \\(\\phi: \\mathsf{G}\\to \\mathsf{H}\\) is a group homomorphism, then \\(\\mathsf{Ker}(\\phi) \\trianglelefteq \\mathsf{G}\\), \\(\\mathsf{Im}(\\phi) \\leq \\mathsf{H}\\). Proposition. (Kernel Cosets): If \\(\\phi: \\mathsf{G}\\to \\mathsf{H}\\) is a group homomorphism, \\(\\mathsf{K}= \\mathsf{Ker}(\\phi)\\), and \\(a,b\\in\\mathsf{G}\\), then \\[ a \\mathsf{K}= b \\mathsf{K}\\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad \\phi(a) = \\phi(b). \\] Def: If \\(\\phi: \\mathsf{G}\\to \\mathsf{H}\\) is a group homomorphism and \\(h \\in \\mathsf{H}\\), then the fiber of \\(h\\) is the following subset of \\(\\mathsf{G}\\): \\[ \\phi^{-1}(h) = \\{g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\mid \\phi(g) = h\\}. \\] That is, these are the elements of \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) that map to \\(h\\). The previous proposition tells us: Corollary: If \\(\\phi: \\mathsf{G}\\to \\mathsf{H}\\) is a homomorphism with kernel \\(\\mathsf{K}\\), then If \\(\\phi(g) = h\\), then \\(\\phi^{-1}(h) = g \\mathsf{K},\\) \\(\\phi\\) is \\(|\\mathsf{K}|\\)-to-one, \\(\\phi\\) is one-to-one if and only if \\(\\mathsf{K}= \\{e\\}\\). Example. The function \\(\\phi: \\mathsf{D}_{6} \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2\\) given by \\(r \\mapsto (1,0)\\) and \\(f \\mapsto (0,1)\\) is a homomorphism. The fibers, and thus \\(\\mathsf{Ker}(\\phi)\\)-cosets, of this function are as follows: \\[ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\phi^{-1}(h) &amp; &amp; h \\\\ \\hline \\mathsf{K}= \\{ 1, r^2, r^4 \\} &amp; \\mapsto &amp; (0,0) \\\\ r \\mathsf{K}= \\{ r, r^3, r^5 \\} &amp; \\mapsto &amp; (1,0) \\\\ f \\mathsf{K}= \\{ f, r^2 f, r^4f \\} &amp; \\mapsto &amp; (0,1) \\\\ rf \\mathsf{K}= \\{ rf, r^3 f, r^5 f \\} &amp; \\mapsto &amp; (1,1) \\\\ \\end{array} \\] We see that \\(\\mathsf{D}_6/\\mathsf{K}\\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2\\) as the next Theorem says in general. Theorem. (First Isomorphism Theorem): If \\(\\phi: \\mathsf{G}\\to \\mathsf{H}\\) is a group homomomorphism, then the following map is an isomorphism, \\[ \\displaystyle{\\frac{\\mathsf{G}}{\\mathsf{Ker}(\\phi)}} \\cong \\mathsf{Im}(\\phi), \\] and the isomorphism is given by sending the coset \\(a \\mathsf{Ker}(\\phi)\\) to \\(\\phi(a)\\). 6.5 Group Actions Def: If \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) is a group and \\(X\\) is a set, then there is an action of \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) on \\(X\\) if for every \\(g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\) and \\(x \\in X\\) we can define \\(g \\cdot x \\in X\\) so that If \\(x \\in X\\), then \\(e \\cdot x = x\\). If \\(x \\in X\\) and \\(g, h \\in \\mathsf{G}\\), then \\((g h) \\cdot x = g \\cdot ( h \\cdot x)\\). Examples. We’ve seen many of these: The symmetric group \\(\\mathsf{S}_n\\) acts on the set \\(X = \\{1,2,3, \\ldots n\\}\\) by permuting the elements of the set. The general linear group \\(GL_n(\\mathbb{R})\\) acts on the set ov vectors \\(X = \\mathbb{R}^n\\) by the matrix vector product \\(A v.\\) The dihedral group \\(\\mathsf{D}_n\\) of symmetries of an \\(n\\)-gon acts on the sets of vertices \\(V\\) and on the set of edges \\(E\\) of the \\(n\\)-gon. Any group \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) acts on itself \\(X = \\mathsf{G}\\) by left (or right) multiplication: \\(g \\cdot x = gx\\). Any group \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) acts on itself \\(X = \\mathsf{G}\\) by conjugation: \\(g \\cdot x = gxg^{-1}\\). Any subgroup \\(\\mathsf{H}\\le \\mathsf{G}\\) acts on \\(X=\\mathsf{G}\\) by left (or right) multiplication: \\(h \\cdot g = h g\\). A group \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) acts on its subgroups \\(\\{ \\mathsf{H}\\mid \\mathsf{H}\\le \\mathsf{G}\\}\\) by conjugation: \\(g \\cdot \\mathsf{H}= g \\mathsf{H}g^{-1}\\) (see Conjugate Subgroups). Def: The stabilizer and orbit of a group action are the sets \\[ \\mathsf{Stab}_\\mathsf{G}(x) = \\{ g \\in G \\mid g \\cdot x = x \\} \\le \\mathsf{G}\\hskip.3in \\mathsf{G}x = \\{ g \\cdot x \\mid g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\} \\subseteq X. \\] Theorem: The stabilizer is a subgroup of \\(\\mathsf{G}\\). Theorem (Orbit-Stabilizer): If \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) acts on \\(X\\) and \\(x \\in X\\), and \\(S = \\mathsf{Stab}_\\mathsf{G}(x)\\), then \\(|\\mathsf{G}| = |S| | \\mathsf{G}x|\\). In particular \\([\\mathsf{G}:S] = |\\mathsf{G}x|\\). If \\(g \\cdot x = y\\), then $ g S = { h h x = y }$.

A commutative ring with unity and no zero divisors is an integral domain. A commutative ring with unity such that every nonzero element is a unit is a field. Here is our ring Venn diagram with many of the examples that we have considered. The following basic properties follow by playing the above rules off one another. Proposition If \\(R\\) is a ring and \\(a,b,c \\in R\\), then \\(a 0 = 0 a = 0.\\) \\(a (-b) = (-a) b = -ab.\\) \\((-a)(-b) = ab.\\) If \\(R\\) has unity, then \\((-1) a = -a\\) and \\((-1)(-1) =1\\). Proposition: If \\(R\\) is a ring with unity, then the set \\(U(R)\\) set of units in \\(R\\) is a group under multiplication. Examples: If \\(R\\) is a commutative ring with unity, then \\(R\\) is a field if and only if \\(U(R) = R \\setminus \\{0\\}\\). \\(U(\\mathbb{Z}_n) = U(n) = \\{ 1 \\le k &lt; n \\mid \\gcd(k,n) = 1 \\}\\). \\(U(\\mathbb{Z}) = \\{1,-1\\}\\). \\(U(\\mathsf{M}_n(\\mathbb{R})) = \\mathsf{GL}_n(\\mathbb{R})\\). Proposition: (Cancelation) If \\(R\\) is an integral domain and \\(a,b,c \\in R\\) with \\(a \\not=0\\), then \\[ ab = a c \\qquad \\Longrightarrow \\qquad b = c. \\] Proposition: (Finite Integral Domain) If \\(R\\) is a finite integral domain, then \\(R\\) is a field. 7.2 Subrings, Ideals, and Quotient Rings Def: If \\(R\\) is a ring, then a subset \\(S\\subseteq R\\) is a subring if it is also a ring under the same addition and multiplication as $ R$. To prove that something is a subring, it is enough to verify the following closure properties. If \\(a,b \\in S\\) then \\(a + b \\in S\\) (closed under addition). If \\(a \\in S\\), then \\(-a \\in S\\) (closed under additive inverses). If \\(a,b \\in S\\), then \\(ab \\in S\\) (closed under multiplication). Def: If \\(R\\) is a ring, then a subset \\(A\\subseteq R\\) is an ideal if it is a subring that absorbs products, as follos: If \\(a,b \\in A\\) then \\(a + b \\in A\\) (closed under addition). If \\(a \\in A\\), then \\(-a \\in A\\) (closed under additive inverses). If \\(a \\in A\\) and \\(r \\in R\\) then \\(ar \\in A\\) and \\(ra \\in A\\) (absorbs products). Ideals are to Rings what normal subgroups are to groups as the following theorem illustrates. Theorem If \\(R\\) is a ring and \\(A \\subseteq R\\) is an ideal, then coset addition and multiplication, defined by \\[ (r + A) + (s + A) = (r+s) + A \\qquad\\hbox{and}\\qquad (r + A) (s + A) = (rs) + A, \\] are well defined and they make \\(R/A\\) into a quotient ring. The zero in the quotient ring is \\(A\\), and if \\(R\\) is a ring with unity, then \\(R/A\\) is a ring with unity equal to \\(1 + A\\). Proposition If \\(R\\) is a ring and \\(A \\subsetneq R\\) is a proper ideal, then If \\(R\\) is commutative, then \\(R/A\\) is commutative If \\(1 \\in R\\) is unity, then \\(1 + A \\in R/A\\) is unity. If \\(u \\in R\\) is a unit, then \\(u + A \\in R/A\\) is a unit. Def: If \\(R\\) is a commutative ring and \\(a \\in R\\), then the principal ideal generated by \\(a\\) is \\[ \\langle a \\rangle = \\{ r a \\mid r \\in R\\}. \\] The principal ideal \\(\\langle a \\rangle\\) is the smallest ideal of \\(R\\) that contains \\(a\\). Theorem A ring \\(R\\) is a field if and only if the only ideals of \\(R\\) are \\(\\{0\\}\\) and \\(R\\). That is, a field \\(R\\) is simple: it has no nonzero, proper ideals. 7.3 Prime and Maximal Ideals 7.3.1 Prime Ideals Def An ideal \\(A\\) is an commutative ring with unity is a prime ideal if it has the property: \\[ \\text{if}\\quad r s \\in A \\quad \\text{ then } \\quad r \\in A \\quad \\text{or} \\quad s \\in A. \\] The definition of prime ideal is constructed to make the following theorem work: Theorem If \\(A\\) is an ideal in a commutative ring \\(R\\) with unity, then \\[ R/A \\quad\\text{is an integral domain} \\qquad\\text{if and only if}\\qquad A \\quad\\text{is a prime ideal}. \\] 7.3.2 Maximal Ideals Def An ideal \\(A\\) in a ring \\(R\\) is a maximal ideal if it has the property that if \\(B\\) is an ideal with \\[ A \\subsetneq B \\subseteq R, \\qquad\\text{then}\\qquad B = R. \\] That is, there are no ideals properly contained bew3een \\(A\\) and \\(R\\).

(Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups) If \\(\\mathsf{G}= \\langle g\\rangle\\), then Every subgroup \\(\\mathsf{H}\\le \\mathsf{G}\\) is cyclic (thus, \\(\\mathsf{H}= \\langle g^k \\rangle\\)). If \\(|g| = \\infty\\) then \\(\\langle g \\rangle = \\{ \\ldots, g^{-3}, g^{-2}, g^{-1}, 1, g, g^2, g^3, \\ldots \\}\\) and all of these elements are distinct. If \\(|g| = n\\) then \\(\\langle g \\rangle = \\{1, g, g^2, \\ldots, g^{n-1} \\}\\) and all of these elements are distinct (thus, \\(|g| = |\\langle g \\rangle|\\)). If \\(|g| = n\\) then the subgroups of \\(\\langle g \\rangle\\) satisfy: \\(\\langle g^k \\rangle = \\langle g^d \\rangle\\), where \\(d = \\gcd(k,n)\\). \\(|\\langle g^k \\rangle| = \\frac{n}{d}= \\frac{n}{\\gcd(k,n)}\\), which is a divisor of \\(n\\). If \\(\\ell \\vert n\\), then \\(|\\langle g^{n/\\ell} \\rangle|\\) is a subgroup of size \\(\\ell\\) and is the only subgroup of size \\(\\ell\\).

We can use it here: gcd(70,42,extended=TRUE) ## $g ## [1] 14 ## ## $c ## [1] -1 ## ## $d ## [1] 2 gcd(68,15,extended=TRUE) ## $g ## [1] 1 ## ## $c ## [1] 2 ## ## $d ## [1] -9 Telling us that \\[ \\begin{align*} 14 &amp; = (-1) 70 + (2) 42 \\\\ 1 &amp; = (2)68 + (-9) 15 \\end{align*} \\] As we can confirm with 2*68 - 9*15 ## [1] 1 13.2 Addition Mod n: \\(\\mathbb{Z}_n\\) We can generate the finite cyclic group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_n = \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n-1\\}\\) easily as follows: n = 12 G = 0:(n-1) # generates an integer sequence from 0 to n-1. G ## [1] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 And then we can add all of these elements mod n and make the Cayley table as follows: n=6 G = 0:(n-1) T = mod(outer(G,G,&quot;+&quot;),n) # the outer sum computes a table of sums i + j rownames(T) = G colnames(T) = G T ## 0 1 2 3 4 5 ## 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 ## 1 1 2 3 4 5 0 ## 2 2 3 4 5 0 1 ## 3 3 4 5 0 1 2 ## 4 4 5 0 1 2 3 ## 5 5 0 1 2 3 4 Even better, we can write a little function to do this.

As you show in PS1.2, \\(U(n)\\) is group under multiplication mod \\(n\\). That is, you show that it is closed under multiplication and that every number that is relatively prime to \\(n\\) has a multipliciative inverse mod \\(n\\).

This is the world we lived in when we worked with square invertible matrices (and the invertible matrix theorem) in Math 236 Linear Algebra. Remember that R has a funny matrix multiplication symbol: %*%. For example, A = cbind(c(1,2,3),c(1,1,1),c(0,1,1)) B = cbind(c(-5,1,1),c(1,1,3),c(1,2,1)) A %*% B ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] -4 2 3 ## [2,] -8 6 5 ## [3,] -13 7 6 B %*% A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 0 -3 2 ## [2,] 9 4 3 ## [3,] 10 5 4 illustrating that matrix multiplication is not-commutative and \\(GL_n(\\mathbb{R})\\) is a nonabelian group.
