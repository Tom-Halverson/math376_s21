You should upload your assignment under the PS1 link on Moodle. You can hand write your solutions and scan them, or typeset them in R or LaTex. But you should upload the assignment in a single PDF or a single HTML file. Ideally, submit the problems in order, but if that is not possible, the problems should be clearly labeled. You should justify all answers, unless the assignment is to compute something. Then you should clearly display your computed work. All assignments will be out of 30 points. For example, this assignment has six 5-point problems. Late work: assignments will be lowered by 10% each day they are late. The solution will be posted on Tuesday. From that point on, I will still accept assignment write-ups, but you can earn a maximum of half of the points. Collaboration is encouraged. In fact, it has been shown that people who form study groups, and talk about assignments, learn more and perform better. However, you should write up your own work in your own words (blatent copying is not acceptable), and if you receive substantial help from a classmate, you should give that person credit in your write-up (no pentalty for this!). 1.1 Modular Multiplication Make the multiplication tables of the following sets and determine which of them are groups under multiplication. You can do this by hand (encouraged to get the feel for it) or using the R commands in Modular Arithmetic. \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\) using multiplication mod 4 \\(\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\) using multiplication mod 5 \\(\\{1,5,7,11\\}\\) using multiplication mod 12 \\(\\{5,15,25,35\\}\\) using multiplication mod 40 1.2 Group of Units \\(U(n)\\) mod n Let \\(U(n) = \\{1 \\le k &lt; n \\mid 1 = \\gcd(k,n) \\}\\). These are the elements of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_n\\) that are relatively prime to \\(n\\). In this problem, we will explore this set and prove that it is a group. Notice: by definition \\(U(n)\\) has the multiplicative identity 1, since \\(gcd(1,n) = 1\\). And, multiplication mod n is associative. So, we need to make sure it is a binary operation on \\(U(n)\\) and that \\(U(n)\\) is closed under taking inverses. Compute the sets \\(U(6),U(7),U(8)\\). Use the R-code in Modular Arithmetic to do the following (you can do it by hand if you prefer). Make the multiplication tables of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_8\\) and \\(U(8)\\) mod 8. Make the multiplication table of \\(U(9)\\). Make the multiplication table of \\(U(14)\\). Show that if \\(a \\in U(n)\\) then \\(a\\) has a multiplicative inverse in \\(U(n)\\). Hint: use the Extended GCD from Chapter 0, the cyclic groups voicethread, and Modular Arithmetic. Show that \\(U(n)\\) is closed under multiplication. That is if \\(a, b \\in U(n)\\), then \\(ab \\in U(n)\\). This shows that multiplication mod \\(n\\) is a binary operation on \\(U(n)\\). Hint 1: if \\(a\\) is invertible mod n and \\(b\\) is invertible mod n, then must \\(ab\\) be invertible mod \\(n\\). Hint 2: think about your shoes and socks. Are \\(U(8)\\), \\(U(9)\\), and/or \\(U(14)\\) cyclic? Justify your answers. 1.3 Two-by-two mod 2 The group \\(GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_2)\\) is the group of all invertible \\(2\\times 2\\) matrices with entries from \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\{0,1\\}\\) and all arithmetic done mod 2. That is, \\[ GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\left\\{ A=\\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d \\end{pmatrix} \\mid a,b,c,d \\in \\{0,1\\} \\hbox{ and $A$ is invertible} \\right\\}. \\] The operation is usual matrix multiplication with arithmetic done mod 2 so that: 0+0 = 0, 0+1 = 1+0 = 1, 1+1 = 0. There are 16 matrices of this form (two choices 0 or 1 for each of the four matrix entries), determine which of these are invertible (you can use the determinant mod 2). Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be the matrices below \\[ A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\qquad\\hbox{and}\\qquad B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{pmatrix}. \\] Show that every element in this group is of the form \\(A^i B^j\\) for some powers \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) (these powers can be 0). Since \\(BA\\) is in the group, it must be equal to \\(A^i B^j\\) for some \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). Find \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). 1.4 Outer Cancellation A group \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) has the special property that for all \\(x,y,z \\in G\\), if \\(xy = zx\\) then \\(y = z\\). Prove that \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) is abelian. 1.5 Distributing Powers Prove that for \\(a, b\\) in a group \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) we have \\[ (ab)^2=a^2b^2 \\quad \\hbox{ if and only if } \\quad ab=ba. \\] 1.6 Cyclic Subgroups If \\(g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\), then \\(\\langle g \\rangle \\le \\mathsf{G}\\) is the smallest subgroup of \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) that contains \\(g\\). We will show in class that \\[ \\begin{array}{rcll} \\langle g \\rangle &amp;=&amp; \\{ g^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}, &amp; \\hbox{if $|g| = \\infty$}.\\\\ \\langle g \\rangle &amp;=&amp; \\{1, g, g^2, \\ldots, g^{n-1}\\}, \\quad &amp; \\hbox{if $|g| = n$}.\\\\ \\end{array} \\] Compute the elements of the following cyclic subgroups. \\(\\langle 5 \\rangle \\le \\mathbb{Z}\\) \\(\\langle 5 \\rangle \\le \\mathbb{Z}_{30}\\) \\(\\langle 5 \\rangle \\le \\mathbb{R}^\\ast\\) \\(\\langle 5 \\rangle \\le U({28})\\) \\(\\langle (\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}i) \\rangle \\le \\mathbb{C}^\\ast\\) "],["problem-set-2.html", "Section 2 Problem Set 2 2.1 Complex Roots of Unity. 2.2 Permutation Computations 2.3 Conjugate Subgroups 2.4 Subgroup of Squares 2.5 Half of a Subgroup 2.6 Symmetry group of the cube 2.7 Extra Credit", " Section 2 Problem Set 2 Due: Friday April 2, 5:00PM CST.

However, you should write up your own work in your own words (blatent copying is not acceptable), and if you receive substantial help from a classmate, you should give that person credit in your write-up (no pentalty for this!). 2.1 Complex Roots of Unity. Let \\(C_{12}\\) be the group consisting of the 12 complex roots of \\(x^{12} - 1 = 0.\\) Draw a picture of this group in the complex plane \\(\\mathbb{C}^\\ast\\). Color in blue each of the points in this group which are generators of \\(C_{12}\\). Draw the subgroup lattice of \\(C_{12}\\). Choose a color for each subgroup (the whole group is blue) and color the generators of each subgroup in your original picture. Each group element should get a color this way. You don’t have to show any work. In your answer to part (a) all of the elements of the group should have a color and your answer to part (b) should indicate which color is associated with which subgroup. Show that the sum of the elements of \\(C_{12}\\) is 0. Do it as follows. We know that \\(x = 1\\) is one of the roots of \\(x^{12} - 1\\). Divide \\((x-1)\\) into \\(x^{12}-1\\) using “old school” polynomial long division. Use your resulting polynomial to answer the questions. 2.2 Permutation Computations The following permutation is given as a product of non-joint cycles in \\(\\mathsf{S}_6\\). Write it in disjoint cycle notation. \\[ \\sigma = (123456) (632)(134)(25) (316) \\] Write the permutation below (a) in disjoint cycle notation, (b) as a product of transpositions, and (c) as a product of adjacent transpositions. Give a different asnwer to (b) than you give for (c). \\[ \\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 \\\\ 4 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 7 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 3 \\\\ \\end{pmatrix} \\] The symmetric group \\(\\mathsf{S}_6\\) has 720 elements. How many of these elements have order 2? How many of these elements have order 4? Justify your answers. The symmetric group \\(\\mathsf{S}_{10}\\) has 3.6 million elements in it. Find a permutation \\(\\sigma \\in \\mathsf{S}_{10}\\) of maximum order. You don’t need to prove that your answer is correct, but describe your strategy. 2.3 Conjugate Subgroups If \\(\\mathsf{H}\\le \\mathsf{G}\\) and \\(g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\) define \\(g \\mathsf{H}g^{-1} = \\{ g h g^{-1} \\mid h \\in \\mathsf{H}\\}\\). This is called the conjugate of \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) by \\(g\\). Prove that \\(g \\mathsf{H}g^{-1}\\) is a subgroup of \\(\\mathsf{G}\\). In the dihedral group \\(D_4\\) find the conjugate subgroup \\(g \\mathsf{H}g^{-1}\\) in the following two cases: \\(\\mathsf{H}= \\{1, f\\}\\) and \\(g = r\\). \\(\\mathsf{H}= \\{1, r^2, f, r^2 f\\}\\) and \\(g = r\\). In the symmetric group \\(S_4\\) of permutations of \\(\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\) let \\(\\mathsf{H}= \\{ \\sigma \\in S_4 \\mid \\sigma(3) = 3 \\}\\) be the subgroup that fixes 3. Compute \\(\\alpha \\mathsf{H}\\alpha^{-1}\\) if \\(\\alpha = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\\\ 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\end{pmatrix}\\). What do the permutations in \\(\\alpha \\mathsf{H}\\alpha^{-1}\\) have in common? 2.4 Subgroup of Squares In a group \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) define the set of squares to be \\(K = \\{ g^2 \\mid g \\in \\mathsf{G}\\}.\\) Prove that if \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) is abelian, then \\(K \\le \\mathsf{G}\\). In \\({\\mathsf{A}}_4\\) (the alternating group of even permutations in \\(\\mathsf{S}_4\\) discussed on Tuesday), find two permutations \\(a,b\\in {\\mathsf{A}}_4\\) such that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are each squares (i.e., \\(a = x^2\\) and \\(b = y^2\\) for \\(x,y \\in {\\mathsf{A}}_4\\)) but \\(ab\\) is not a square. This shows that if \\(G\\) is nonabelian \\(K\\) may not be a subgroup (this is the smallest group that exhibits this phenomenon). 2.5 Half of a Subgroup Prove that if \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) is a subgroup of \\(\\mathsf{S}_n\\) then either \\(\\mathsf{H}\\le {\\mathsf{A}}_n\\) or exactly half of \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) is even and half of \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) is odd. Hint: If \\(\\mathsf{H}\\) has an element \\(\\alpha\\) of odd order, then define a map \\[ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\mathsf{H}&amp;\\to&amp; \\mathsf{H}\\\\ h &amp; \\mapsto &amp; h \\alpha \\\\ \\end{array} \\] Argue that the image of this map is \\(\\mathsf{H}\\)? What does this map do to even elements? to odd elements? Prove: If \\(\\mathsf{H}\\le \\mathsf{S}_n\\) has odd order, then \\(\\mathsf{H}\\le {\\mathsf{A}}_n\\). 2.6 Symmetry group of the cube The symmetric group \\(\\mathsf{S}_4\\) is isomorphic to the rotation group of a cube. There are four long diagonals of the cube. In the picture below, these diagonals connect the vertices labeled 1 to one another, the vertices labeled 2 to one another, the vertices labeled 3 to one another, and the vertices labeled 4 to one another. (They are color coded). The rotation corresponding to the permutation \\(\\sigma \\in \\mathsf{S}_4\\) permutes diagonal \\(i\\) to diagonal \\(j\\) if \\(\\sigma(i) = j\\). For example, the rotation corresponding to the 4-cycle \\(\\sigma = (1,2,3,4)\\) is shown here. Find the rotation corresponding to each of the permutations below (given below in cycle notation). For each of them, indicate the axes of rotation and the number of radians (and direction) that you rotate by, and give the before and after picture with the vertices labeled and colored as I have done above for \\((1,2,3,4)\\). \\((1,2)\\) \\((1,2,3)\\) \\((1,2)(3,4)\\) I recommend using a paper model of the cube. 2.7 Extra Credit (2 pts) Give, with proof, a formula for the number of permutations of cycle type \\(\\mu = [\\mu_1, \\mu_2, \\ldots, \\mu_\\ell]\\).

(Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups) If \\(\\mathsf{G}= \\langle g\\rangle\\), then Every subgroup \\(\\mathsf{H}\\le \\mathsf{G}\\) is cyclic (thus, \\(\\mathsf{H}= \\langle g^k \\rangle\\)). If \\(|g| = \\infty\\) then \\(\\langle g \\rangle = \\{ \\ldots, g^{-3}, g^{-2}, g^{-1}, 1, g, g^2, g^3, \\ldots \\}\\) and all of these elements are distinct. If \\(|g| = n\\) then \\(\\langle g \\rangle = \\{1, g, g^2, \\ldots, g^{n-1} \\}\\) and all of these elements are distinct (thus, \\(|g| = |\\langle g \\rangle|\\)). If \\(|g| = n\\) then the subgroups of \\(\\langle g \\rangle\\) satisfy: \\(\\langle g^k \\rangle = \\langle g^d \\rangle\\), where \\(d = \\gcd(k,n)\\). \\(|\\langle g^k \\rangle| = \\frac{n}{d}= \\frac{n}{\\gcd(k,n)}\\), which is a divisor of \\(n\\). If \\(\\ell \\vert n\\), then \\(|\\langle g^{n/\\ell} \\rangle|\\) is a subgroup of size \\(\\ell\\) and is the only subgroup of size \\(\\ell\\). Note: (d) says that, in a finite cyclic group of order \\(n\\), there is exactly one subgroup for each divisor of \\(n\\) and those are all the subgroups. Corollary If \\(\\mathsf{G}= \\langle g \\rangle\\) is a finite cyclic group of order \\(n\\). Then \\(\\mathsf{G}= \\langle g^k rangle\\) if and only if \\(\\gcd(k,n) = 1\\).

As you show in PS1.2, \\(U(n)\\) is group under multiplication mod \\(n\\). That is, you show that it is closed under multiplication and that every number that is relatively prime to \\(n\\) has a multipliciative inverse mod \\(n\\). The functions below will give us \\(\\mathbb{Z}_n\\) and \\(U_n\\). Cyclic &lt;- function(n) { 0:(n-1) } Units &lt;- function(n) { (1:(n-1))[gcd(1:(n-1),n)==1] } For example, Cyclic(10) ## [1] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Units(10) ## [1] 1 3 7 9 We can multiply these by writing a MultTable function that uses the outer product MultTable &lt;- function(G,n,op=&quot;*&quot;) { T = mod(outer(G,G,op),n) rownames(T) = G colnames(T) = G return(T) } And we try it out: MultTable(Cyclic(10),10) ## 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ## 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ## 2 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8 ## 3 0 3 6 9 2 5 8 1 4 7 ## 4 0 4 8 2 6 0 4 8 2 6 ## 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 ## 6 0 6 2 8 4 0 6 2 8 4 ## 7 0 7 4 1 8 5 2 9 6 3 ## 8 0 8 6 4 2 0 8 6 4 2 ## 9 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 MultTable(Units(10),10) ## 1 3 7 9 ## 1 1 3 7 9 ## 3 3 9 1 7 ## 7 7 1 9 3 ## 9 9 7 3 1 MultTable(Units(2),2,op=&quot;*&quot;) ## 1 ## 1 1 MultTable(Units(3),3,op=&quot;*&quot;) ## 1 2 ## 1 1 2 ## 2 2 1 MultTable(Units(5),5,op=&quot;*&quot;) ## 1 2 3 4 ## 1 1 2 3 4 ## 2 2 4 1 3 ## 3 3 1 4 2 ## 4 4 3 2 1 MultTable(Units(7),7,op=&quot;*&quot;) ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## 2 2 4 6 1 3 5 ## 3 3 6 2 5 1 4 ## 4 4 1 5 2 6 3 ## 5 5 3 1 6 4 2 ## 6 6 5 4 3 2 1 MultTable(Units(11),11,op=&quot;*&quot;) ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ## 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ## 2 2 4 6 8 10 1 3 5 7 9 ## 3 3 6 9 1 4 7 10 2 5 8 ## 4 4 8 1 5 9 2 6 10 3 7 ## 5 5 10 4 9 3 8 2 7 1 6 ## 6 6 1 7 2 8 3 9 4 10 5 ## 7 7 3 10 6 2 9 5 1 8 4 ## 8 8 5 2 10 7 4 1 9 6 3 ## 9 9 7 5 3 1 10 8 6 4 2 ## 10 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Suppose that we want to know the order of 5 in U(22).

This is the world we lived in when we worked with square invertible matrices (and the invertible matrix theorem) in Math 236 Linear Algebra. Remember that R has a funny matrix multiplication symbol: %*%. For example, A = cbind(c(1,2,3),c(1,1,1),c(0,1,1)) B = cbind(c(-5,1,1),c(1,1,3),c(1,2,1)) A %*% B ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] -4 2 3 ## [2,] -8 6 5 ## [3,] -13 7 6 B %*% A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 0 -3 2 ## [2,] 9 4 3 ## [3,] 10 5 4 illustrating that matrix multiplication is not-commutative and \\(GL_n(\\mathbb{R})\\) is a nonabelian group.

Now, we can plot \\(\\langle z \\rangle\\) by raising it to a bunch of powers and plotting it according to its real and imaginary parts. You see that the positive powers of z cycle out to infinity and the negative powers cycle in to 0.

For this first example, we will use a point that is 1/14 of the way around the circle. Notice that we are choosing \\(r = 1\\) to get a point on the unit circle. \\[ w = e^{2 \\pi i/14} = 0.9009698 + 0.4338837 i \\] n = 14 ii = 0+1i w = exp(2*pi*ii/n) w ## [1] 0.9009689+0.4338837i When we plot \\(\\langle w \\rangle\\) we get In this case we get a cyclic subgroup of order 14 \\[ \\langle w \\rangle = \\{1, w, w^2, \\dots, w^{13}\\} \\le \\mathbb{C}^\\ast, \\] and we really see, geometrically, why the term cyclic subgroup makes sense, because the numbers cycle around. We can even see subgroups in here. For example, the next picture shows the subgroup \\(\\langle w^2 \\rangle \\le \\langle w \\rangle\\). \\[ \\langle w^2 \\rangle = \\{1, w^2, w^4, w^6, w^8, w^{10}, w^{12}\\} \\le \\{1, w, w^2,w^3,w^4,w^5,w^6,w^7,w^8,w^9,w^{10},w^{11},w^{12} w^{13}\\} = \\langle w \\rangle. \\] In this example, the complex number \\(w\\) has the property that \\[ w^{14} = 1. \\] and if we take any other element fro the group it also has this property \\[ \\text{ if } \\quad w^j \\in \\langle w \\rangle \\quad \\text{then} \\quad (w^j)^{14} = w^{14 j} = (w^{14})^j = 1^j = 1. \\] So all 14 elements of \\(\\langle w rangle\\) are solutions to the equation \\[ x^{14} = 1 \\qquad \\hbox{or} \\qquad x^{14} - 1 = 0. \\] Since this is a 14th degree polynomial equation, it has 14 complex solutions (according to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra), and so these are all of the solutions to this equation. There are two real solutions 1 and -1 and the other 12 are purely complex. These are called the 14th roots of unity. 9.2.1 Cube Roots of Unity The cube roots of unity are solutions to \\(x^3 - 1 = 0\\). They are generated by the complex number that is 1/3 of the way around the circle. \\[ w = e^{2 \\pi i /3} = \\cos(2 \\pi/3) + \\sin(2 \\pi/3) i = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} i. \\] They generate a cyclic group of order 3: \\[ \\langle w \\rangle = \\{ w^0 = 1, \\quad w = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} i, \\quad w^2 = - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} i\\} \\] which we see here: 9.2.2 4th Roots of Unity The 4th roots of unity are solutions to \\(x^4 - 1 = 0\\).

You should upload your assignment under the PS1 link on Moodle. You can hand write your solutions and scan them, or typeset them in R or LaTex. But you should upload the assignment in a single PDF or a single HTML file. Ideally, submit the problems in order, but if that is not possible, the problems should be clearly labeled. You should justify all answers, unless the assignment is to compute something. Then you should clearly display your computed work. All assignments will be out of 30 points. For example, this assignment has six 5-point problems. Late work: assignments will be lowered by 10% each day they are late. The solution will be posted on Tuesday. From that point on, I will still accept assignment write-ups, but you can earn a maximum of half of the points. Collaboration is encouraged. In fact, it has been shown that people who form study groups, and talk about assignments, learn more and perform better. However, you should write up your own work in your own words (blatent copying is not acceptable), and if you receive substantial help from a classmate, you should give that person credit in your write-up (no pentalty for this!). 1.1 Modular Multiplication Make the multiplication tables of the following sets and determine which of them are groups under multiplication. You can do this by hand (encouraged to get the feel for it) or using the R commands in Modular Arithmetic. \\(\\{1,2,3\\}\\) using multiplication mod 4 \\(\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\) using multiplication mod 5 \\(\\{1,5,7,11\\}\\) using multiplication mod 12 \\(\\{5,15,25,35\\}\\) using multiplication mod 40 1.2 Group of Units \\(U(n)\\) mod n Let \\(U(n) = \\{1 \\le k &lt; n \\mid 1 = \\gcd(k,n) \\}\\). These are the elements of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_n\\) that are relatively prime to \\(n\\). In this problem, we will explore this set and prove that it is a group. Notice: by definition \\(U(n)\\) has the multiplicative identity 1, since \\(gcd(1,n) = 1\\). And, multiplication mod n is associative. So, we need to make sure it is a binary operation on \\(U(n)\\) and that \\(U(n)\\) is closed under taking inverses. Compute the sets \\(U(6),U(7),U(8)\\). Use the R-code in Modular Arithmetic to do the following (you can do it by hand if you prefer). Make the multiplication tables of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_8\\) and \\(U(8)\\) mod 8. Make the multiplication table of \\(U(9)\\). Make the multiplication table of \\(U(14)\\). Show that if \\(a \\in U(n)\\) then \\(a\\) has a multiplicative inverse in \\(U(n)\\). Hint: use the Extended GCD from Chapter 0, the cyclic groups voicethread, and Modular Arithmetic. Show that \\(U(n)\\) is closed under multiplication. That is if \\(a, b \\in U(n)\\), then \\(ab \\in U(n)\\). This shows that multiplication mod \\(n\\) is a binary operation on \\(U(n)\\). Hint 1: if \\(a\\) is invertible mod n and \\(b\\) is invertible mod n, then must \\(ab\\) be invertible mod \\(n\\). Hint 2: think about your shoes and socks. Are \\(U(8)\\), \\(U(9)\\), and/or \\(U(14)\\) cyclic?

That is, \\[ GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\left\\{ A=\\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d \\end{pmatrix} \\mid a,b,c,d \\in \\{0,1\\} \\hbox{ and $A$ is invertible} \\right\\}. \\] The operation is usual matrix multiplication with arithmetic done mod 2 so that: 0+0 = 0, 0+1 = 1+0 = 1, 1+1 = 0. There are 16 matrices of this form (two choices 0 or 1 for each of the four matrix entries), determine which of these are invertible (you can use the determinant mod 2). Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be the matrices below \\[ A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\qquad\\hbox{and}\\qquad B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{pmatrix}. \\] Show that every element in this group is of the form \\(A^i B^j\\) for some powers \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) (these powers can be 0). Since \\(BA\\) is in the group, it must be equal to \\(A^i B^j\\) for some \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). Find \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). 1.4 Outer Cancellation A group \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) has the special property that for all \\(x,y,z \\in G\\), if \\(xy = zx\\) then \\(y = z\\).

Let \\(C_{12}\\) be the group consisting of the 12 complex roots of \\(x^{12} - 1 = 0.\\) Draw a picture of this group in the complex plane \\(\\mathbb{C}^\\ast\\). Color in blue each of the points in this group which are generators of \\(C_{12}\\). Draw the subgroup lattice of \\(C_{12}\\). Choose a color for each subgroup (the whole group is blue) and color the generators of each subgroup in your original picture. Each group element should get a color this way. You don’t have to show any work. In your answer to part (a) all of the elements of the group should have a color and your answer to part (b) should indicate which color is associated with which subgroup. Show that the sum of the elements of \\(C_{12}\\) is 0. Do it as follows. We know that \\(x = 1\\) is one of the roots of \\(x^{12} - 1\\). Divide \\((x-1)\\) into \\(x^{12}-1\\) using “old school” polynomial long division.

The identity matrix is the identity element of the group, and it can be defined with diag(n). If you have pracma loaded then you can invert the matrix A with inv(A) otherwise, in base R, you can use solve(A). inv(A) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 0 -1 1 ## [2,] 1 1 -1 ## [3,] -1 2 -1 zapsmall(A %*% inv(A)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 0 0 ## [2,] 0 1 0 ## [3,] 0 0 1 diag(3) %*% A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 0 ## [2,] 2 1 1 ## [3,] 3 1 1 8.2 Matrix Multiplication Mod m: \\(GL_n(\\mathbb{Z}_m)\\) You can use the mod command from pracma to do matrix multiplication mod m. For example, notice how the product looks very different for different \\(\\mathbb{Z}_m\\). A = rbind(c(1,3),c(2,7)) B = rbind(c(5,4),c(-3,-2)) A %*% B ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] -4 -2 ## [2,] -11 -6 mod(A %*% B,2) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 0 0 ## [2,] 1 0 mod(A %*% B,3) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 2 1 ## [2,] 1 0 mod(A %*% B,4) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 0 2 ## [2,] 1 2 "],["complex-n-th-roots-of-unity.html", "Section 9 Complex n-th roots of unity 9.1 Cyclic subgroups of \\(\\mathbb{C}^\\ast\\) 9.2 Roots of Unity", " Section 9 Complex n-th roots of unity 9.1 Cyclic subgroups of \\(\\mathbb{C}^\\ast\\) Let’s look at the cyclic subgroup generated by the complex number given in polar and rectangular form by \\[ z = 1.02 e^{2 \\pi i /17} = 0.9511 + 0.3685 i \\] First, here is how to define it in R. n = 17 ii = 0+1i z = 1.02*exp(2*pi*ii/n) z ## [1] 0.9511217+0.3684665i Observe that the length of \\(z\\) is 1.02 and its angle is \\(2 \\pi/17\\), or \\(1/17\\) of a circle. Now, we can plot \\(\\langle z \\rangle\\) by raising it to a bunch of powers and plotting it according to its real and imaginary parts. You see that the positive powers of z cycle out to infinity and the negative powers cycle in to 0. G = z^(-50:100) plot(Re(G),Im(G),col=&#39;gray&#39;,xlim=c(-2,2),ylim=c(-2,2),type=&#39;l&#39;,xlab=&quot;Re&quot;,ylab=&quot;Im&quot;) grid() points(Re(G),Im(G),col=&#39;black&#39;,pch=19) points(Re(z),Im(z),pch=19,col=&#39;blue&#39;) In this case we get an infinite cyclic group \\[ \\langle z \\rangle = \\{ \\ldots, z^{-3}, z^{-2}, z^{-1}, 1, z, z^2, z^3, \\ldots \\} \\le \\mathbb{C}^\\ast, \\] and all of these powers of \\(z\\) are distinct elements in $^ 9.2 Roots of Unity Suppose now that we pick a point on the unit circle and do the same thing. For this first example, we will use a point that is 1/14 of the way around the circle. Notice that we are choosing \\(r = 1\\) to get a point on the unit circle. \\[ w = e^{2 \\pi i/14} = 0.9009698 + 0.4338837 i \\] n = 14 ii = 0+1i w = exp(2*pi*ii/n) w ## [1] 0.9009689+0.4338837i When we plot \\(\\langle w \\rangle\\) we get In this case we get a cyclic subgroup of order 14 \\[ \\langle w \\rangle = \\{1, w, w^2, \\dots, w^{13}\\} \\le \\mathbb{C}^\\ast, \\] and we really see, geometrically, why the term cyclic subgroup makes sense, because the numbers cycle around. We can even see subgroups in here. For example, the next picture shows the subgroup \\(\\langle w^2 \\rangle \\le \\langle w \\rangle\\). \\[ \\langle w^2 \\rangle = \\{1, w^2, w^4, w^6, w^8, w^{10}, w^{12}\\} \\le \\{1, w, w^2,w^3,w^4,w^5,w^6,w^7,w^8,w^9,w^{10},w^{11},w^{12} w^{13}\\} = \\langle w \\rangle. \\] In this example, the complex number \\(w\\) has the property that \\[ w^{14} = 1. \\] and if we take any other element fro the group it also has this property \\[ \\text{ if } \\quad w^j \\in \\langle w \\rangle \\quad \\text{then} \\quad (w^j)^{14} = w^{14 j} = (w^{14})^j = 1^j = 1. \\] So all 14 elements of \\(\\langle w rangle\\) are solutions to the equation \\[ x^{14} = 1 \\qquad \\hbox{or} \\qquad x^{14} - 1 = 0. \\] Since this is a 14th degree polynomial equation, it has 14 complex solutions (according to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra), and so these are all of the solutions to this equation. There are two real solutions 1 and -1 and the other 12 are purely complex. These are called the 14th roots of unity. 9.2.1 Cube Roots of Unity The cube roots of unity are solutions to \\(x^3 - 1 = 0\\). They are generated by the complex number that is 1/3 of the way around the circle. \\[ w = e^{2 \\pi i /3} = \\cos(2 \\pi/3) + \\sin(2 \\pi/3) i = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} i. \\] They generate a cyclic group of order 3: \\[ \\langle w \\rangle = \\{ w^0 = 1, \\quad w = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} i, \\quad w^2 = - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} i\\} \\] which we see here: 9.2.2 4th Roots of Unity The 4th roots of unity are solutions to \\(x^4 - 1 = 0\\). They are generated by \\(i\\): \\[ w = e^{2 \\pi i /4} = \\cos(\\pi/2) + \\sin(\\pi/2) i = i. \\] and \\[ \\langle i \\rangle = \\{1, i, -1, - i\\}. \\] They generate a cyclic group of order 4: 9.2.3 8th Roots of Unity The 8th roots of unity are solutions to \\(x^8 - 1 = 0\\). They are generated by \\(i\\): \\[ w = e^{2 \\pi i /8} = \\cos(\\pi/4) + \\sin(\\pi/4) i = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} i. \\] They generate a cyclic group of order 8: "]]
