Prove that \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) is abelian. 1.2 Two-by-two mod 2 Let \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) be the group of all invertible \\(2\\times 2\\) matrices with entries from \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\{0,1\\}\\) and all arithmetic done mod 2. \\[ \\mathsf{G}= \\left\\{ A=\\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d \\end{pmatrix} \\mid a,b,c,d \\in \\{0,1\\} \\hbox{ and $A$ is invertible} \\right\\}. \\] The operation is usual matrix multiplication with arithmetic done mod 2 so that: 0+0 = 0, 0+1 = 1+0 = 1, 1+1 = 0. There are 16 matrices of this form (two choices 0 or 1 for each of the four matrix entries), determine which of these are invertible. Then make the multiplication table for this group. 1.3 Distributing Powers Prove that for \\(a, b\\) in a group \\(\\mathsf{G}\\) we have \\[ (ab)^2=a^2b^2 \\quad \\hbox{ if and only if } \\quad ab=ba. \\] "],["cyclic-groups.html", "Section 2 Cyclic Groups 2.1 Overview", " Section 2 Cyclic Groups 2.1 Overview The finite cyclic group is "]]
