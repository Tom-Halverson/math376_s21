# Problem Set 4


**Due**: Sunday April 25, 2:00PM CST.  Same rules as previous assignments. Time will be provided *in class* this week to work on these and discuss them with your peers. 

## Boolean Rings

Let $R$ be a ring in which $a^2 = a$ for every $a \in R.$

a. Prove that $R$ is commutative. (Hint: cleverly use the $a^2 = a$ property and don't forget that we have addition in $R$).

b. Prove that if $R$ has unity and $a \not= 0,1$ then $a$ is a zero divisor.

c. Give an example of a Boolean ring with unity having 4 elements.

## Subsets, Subrings, and Ideals

Each example below describes a subset $S \subseteq R$. Determine (with proof) whether $S$ is "just" a subset or is a subring or is an ideal. 

a. $R = \ZZ[x]$ and $S$ is the set of polynomials with 0 constant term: $S = \{ p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n \in \ZZ[x] \mid a_0 = 0\}$.

b. $R = \ZZ[x]$ and $S$ is the set of polynomials with an even constant term: $S = \{ p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n \in \ZZ[x] \mid a_0 \in 2 \ZZ \}$.

c. $R = \ZZ[x]$ and $S$ is the set of polynomials with a zero quadratic term: $S = \{ p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \cdots + a_n x^n \in \ZZ[x]\mid a_2 = 0 \}$.

d. $R$ is a commutative ring, $a \in R$, and $S = \{ r \in R \mid r a = 0 \}$.

e. $R$ is a ring and $S = \{ s \in R \mid s r = r s \text{ for all } r \in R\}$.
