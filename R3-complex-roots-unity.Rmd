# Complex n-th roots of unity

More information forthcoming. Here are the complex 14-th roots of unity. These are the 14 solutions to the equation $x^{14} - 1 = 0$. There are only 2 real solutions $1$ and $-1$.

```{r,fig.width=4.5,fig.height=4.5}
n = 14
ii = 0+1i
w = exp(2*pi*ii/n)
G = w^(0:(n-1))
G
plot(Re(G),Im(G),col='red',pch=19)
