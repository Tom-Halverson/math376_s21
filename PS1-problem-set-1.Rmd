## Modular Multiplication

Make the *multiplication* tables of the following sets and determine which of them are groups under multiplication:

a. $\{1,2,3\}$ using multiplication mod 4
b. $\{1,2,3,4\}$ using multiplication mod 5
c. $\{1,5,7,11\}$ using multiplication mod 12
d. $\{5,15,25,35\}$ using multiplication mod 40

## Group of Units $U_n$ mod n

Let $U_n = \{1 \le k < n \mid 1 = \gcd(k,n) \}$. These are the elements of $\ZZ_n$ that are relatively prime to $n$. Note: the book denotes this by $U(n)$.

a. Compute the sets $U_6,U_7,U_8$.

b. Use the R-code in [Modular Arithmetic] to do the following (you can do it by hand if you prefer).

    i. Make the multiplication tables of $\ZZ_8$ and $U_8$ mod 8.
    ii. Make the multiplication table of $U_9$.
    iii. Make the multiplication table of $U_{14}$.

c. We will show that $U_n$ is a **group** under *multiplication* mod n. Multiplication mod n is **associative** so we don't need to do that, and the multiplicative **identity** $1$ is in $U_n$, since $gcd(n,1) = 1$.  Show that if $a \in U_n$ then $a$ has a multiplicative **inverse** in $U_n$. Do this by using the Extended GCD from Chapter 0 (the Extended GCD also appears in the VoiceThread on Cyclic Groups).

d. Show that $U_n$ is closed under multiplication. That is if $a, b \in U_n$, then $ab \in U_n$. This shows that multiplication mod $n$ is a **binary operation** on $U_n$. Hint: if $a$ is invertible mod n and $b$ is invertible mod n, then must $ab$ be invertible mod $n$; think about your shoes and socks.

e. Are $U_8$, $U_9$, and/or $U_{14}$ cyclic? Justify your answers.

## Two-by-two mod 2

The group $GL_2(\ZZ_2)$ is the group of all invertible $2\times 2$ matrices with entries from $\ZZ_2 = \{0,1\}$ and all arithmetic done mod 2. That is,
$$
GL_2(\ZZ_2) =
\left\{
A=\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} 
\mid a,b,c,d \in \{0,1\} \hbox{ and $A$ is invertible}
\right\}.
$$
The operation is usual matrix multiplication with arithmetic done mod 2 so that: 0+0 = 0, 0+1 = 1+0 = 1, 1+1 = 0. 

a. There are 16 matrices of this form (two choices 0 or 1 for each of the four matrix entries), determine which of these are invertible (you can use the determinant mod 2). 

b. Let $A$ and $B$ be the matrices below
$$
A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \qquad\hbox{and}\qquad
B = \begin{pmatrix}  1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
$$
Show that every element in this group is of the form $A^i B^j$ for some powers $i$ and $j$ (these powers can be 0).

c. Since $BA$ is in the group, it must be equal to $A^i B^j$ for some $i$ and $j$. Find $i$ and $j$.


## Outer Cancellation

A group $\G$ has the special property that for all $x,y,z \in G$, if $xy = zx$ then $y = z$. Prove that $\G$ is abelian.



## Distributing Powers

Prove that for $a, b$ in a group $\G$ we have
$$
(ab)^2=a^2b^2
\quad \hbox{ if and only if } \quad 
ab=ba.
$$
