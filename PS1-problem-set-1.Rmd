## Modular Multiplication

Make the *multiplication* tables of the following sets and determine which of them are groups under multiplication:

a. $\{1,2,3\}$ using multiplication mod 4
b. $\{1,2,3,4\}$ using multiplication mod 5
c. $\{1,5,7,11\}$ using multiplication mod 12

## Outer Cancellation

A group $\G$ has the special property that for all $x,y,z \in G$, if $xy = zx$ then $y = z$. Prove that $\G$ is abelian.

## Two-by-two mod 2

Let $\G$ be the group of all invertible $2\times 2$ matrices with entries from $\ZZ_2 = \{0,1\}$ and all arithmetic done mod 2. That is,
$$
\G=
\left\{
A=\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} 
\mid a,b,c,d \in \{0,1\} \hbox{ and $A$ is invertible}
\right\}.
$$
The operation is usual matrix multiplication with arithmetic done mod 2 so that: 0+0 = 0, 0+1 = 1+0 = 1, 1+1 = 0. There are 16 matrices of this form (two choices 0 or 1 for each of the four matrix entries), determine which of these are invertible. Then make the multiplication table for this group.

## Distributing Powers

Prove that for $a, b$ in a group $\G$ we have
$$
(ab)^2=a^2b^2
\quad \hbox{ if and only if } \quad 
ab=ba.
$$
