## Groups

### Group

A **group** is a set $\G$ with a binary operation $\ast$ that satisfies the following:

a. (Identity) There exists $e \in \G$ such that $e \ast g= g \ast e = g$ for all $g \in \G$.

b. (Inverse) For all $g \in \G$, there exists $g^{-1} \in \G$ such that $g \ast g^{-1} = g^{-1} \ast g = e$.

c. (Associativity) $(ab)c = a (bc)$ for all $a,b,c \in \G$
